# digital_storytelling_adobe_premiere
Getting started with Adobe Premiere for digital storytelling

This tutorial is designed for classroom use (approx. 60 minutes) by my undergraduate students at UCLA. ([See how it's incorporated on my syllabus.](https://miriamposner.com/classes/dh150s23/)) These are Digital Humanities minors who have experience with computers, but not necessarily with video or editing. We've talked about film composition and structure, but this is their first experience with hands-on editing. Students are instructed to have Adobe Premiere Pro installed on their computers and to bring media files to assemble into a story.

This tutorial will be followed by a tutorial on audio editing in Premiere, as well as instructions for storyboarding and scriptwriting.
